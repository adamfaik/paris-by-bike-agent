# The Practical Guide to Paris by Bike: A Monument-by-Monument Strategy for Routes & Racks


## Section 1: The Parisian Cyclist's Toolkit: Preparation & Strategy

Successfully navigating Paris by bicycle is not a matter of chance; it is the result of strategic preparation. The city has undergone a profound transformation, investing heavily in a "Plan Vélo" to become a leading cyclable capital.<sup>1</sup> This investment has created a network of safe, segregated routes but also a complex urban environment that requires specific tools and knowledge. This section details the non-negotiable foundations for a safe and efficient cycling tour, addressing digital navigation, bicycle choice, security protocols, and logistical constraints.


### 1.1 Digital Navigation: The Géovélo Application

While static maps are useful for planning, the dynamic nature of urban cycling—replete with construction, traffic, and real-time parking availability—necessitates a digital co-pilot. The City of Paris officially recommends and partners with the **Géovélo** application.<sup>3</sup>

Géovélo is a GPS navigator designed exclusively for cyclists. Unlike car- or pedestrian-focused maps, its routing algorithm prioritizes safety and cyclist comfort. The application allows users to select a route profile, from "safest" (prioritizing segregated paths and low-traffic streets) to "fastest".<sup>4</sup>

Critically, the Géovélo application contains a map layer that specifically displays bicycle parking facilities.<sup>6</sup> This feature directly addresses the challenge of locating 'arceaux' (hoops) in real-time. This guide will provide the strategic zones to search, but the Géovélo app is the indispensable tool for locating an available rack upon arrival. The app is available for all major mobile operating systems <sup>7</sup> and provides comprehensive mapping of bike lanes and parking.<sup>6</sup>


### 1.2 Strategic Alternatives: The Vélib' Métropole System as a Parking Solution

A primary consideration for any cyclist in Paris is the high risk of bicycle theft. This risk dictates the need for heavy-duty, expensive locks and creates anxiety when leaving a personal bike unattended. The Vélib' Métropole, Paris's public bike-share system, presents a superior strategic alternative for tourists by functioning as both transport and a secure parking solution.

The Vélib' system is one of the largest in the world, with approximately 1,500 stations and 20,000 bicycles (40% of which are electric).<sup>9</sup> Stations are ubiquitous, with a location available "every 300 meters in Paris".<sup>9</sup>

The "Vélib' as Parking" strategy entirely eliminates the risk of personal bicycle theft. The journey is complete when the Vélib' is securely docked at an official station. The Vélib' station, therefore, *becomes* the parking. This guide will list the key Vélib' stations for each monument alongside 'arceaux' locations, as this represents the most secure and efficient method for sightseeing.

This strategy has one common complication: docking stations at popular destinations can become full. To mitigate this, cyclists must use the official **Vélib' Métropole app**.<sup>10</sup> This app provides a real-time map of all stations, showing the exact number of available bikes and, most importantly, the number of empty docks.<sup>10</sup> The correct procedure is to check the app *before* cycling to the monument to identify a primary and secondary docking station.


### 1.3 Bicycle Security (Personal Bikes)

For those who elect to use a personal or long-term rental bicycle, security is the highest priority. Paris has an estimated 60,000 public 'arceaux à vélos' (metal hoop stands) <sup>12</sup>, but competition for them is high, and theft is professional and rampant.

The minimum viable security standard is a high-quality U-lock (or 'antivol U').<sup>13</sup> Cable locks are insufficient and should not be used for any duration.<sup>15</sup> The most respected security certifications to look for are "Sold Secure Gold" or "ART 3".<sup>16</sup>

Proper locking technique is as important as the lock itself. The "5 Golden Rules" from the French Federation of Bicycle Users (FUB) stress that the bicycle must *always* be secured to a fixed point.<sup>17</sup> The U-lock must pass through the bicycle frame and, if possible, the rear wheel, before securing to the 'arceau'.<sup>17</sup> The City of Paris provides an official interactive map of all 'arceaux' locations, which can be found on its open-data portal.<sup>12</sup>


### 1.4 Logistical Constraints: Bicycle Transport on Métro and RER

A common logistical error for visitors is assuming that cycling can be combined with Paris's public transit system. The regulations are highly restrictive and create a significant risk of fines and disruption.



* **Paris Métro:** With one minor and complex exception (Line 1 on Sundays and holidays) <sup>19</sup>, bicycles are **strictly forbidden** on the entire Métro network.<sup>20</sup> It is also forbidden to use escalators with a bike.<sup>20</sup>
* **Paris RER:** Bicycles *are* permitted on RER lines (A, B, C, D, E), but with severe time restrictions.<sup>21</sup> They are **banned** during peak weekday rush hours: Monday to Friday, from 6:30 AM to 9:30 AM, and from 4:30 PM to 7:30 PM.<sup>21</sup>

Attempting to board during these times will result in a fine, which can be as high as €150 for obstructing traffic.<sup>22</sup> The most practical and strategic conclusion is to treat the Paris public transport network as incompatible with a bicycle. The city is compact enough to be traversed entirely by bike.


## Section 2: Decoding the Parisian Street: Safety, Signs, & Etiquette

Cycling in Paris requires adherence to the French Highway Code (Code de la Route) and an understanding of specific, often unwritten, local rules.<sup>12</sup> This knowledge is essential for ensuring safety and navigating the city's flow.


### 2.1 Rules of the Road: Pedestrian Priority & Bike Boxes ('Sas Vélo')

While Paris has become more cycle-friendly, it remains a dense urban environment where cyclists must coexist with heavy pedestrian and vehicle traffic.



* **Pedestrian Priority:** Pedestrians *always* have priority.<sup>12</sup> This is an absolute rule, especially in 'zone de rencontre' (meeting zones) where pedestrians have priority over all vehicles, including bikes, and traffic is limited to 20 km/h.<sup>24</sup>
* **Pavement Riding:** Riding on pavements is strictly prohibited unless it is a clearly marked, integrated cycle path.<sup>12</sup>
* **'Sas Vélo' (Bike Boxes):** At many traffic lights, cyclists will find a 'sas vélo', or advanced stop box, painted on the road.<sup>26</sup> This is a key safety feature, allowing cyclists to position themselves ahead of vehicles.<sup>27</sup> Motor vehicles are prohibited from stopping in this space.
* **Bus Lanes:** Many bus lanes ('couloir de bus') are shared with cyclists.<sup>28</sup> While legal, these lanes require caution. A cyclist should never overtake a bus on the right, especially when the bus is stopped at a station, due to significant blind spots.<sup>12</sup>
* **Headphones and Phones:** It is illegal to cycle while wearing headphones, earphones, or while holding a phone.<sup>12</sup> This is strictly enforced and carries a fine.


### 2.2 The Parisian Red Light: Understanding the 'Cédez-le-Passage M12' Sign

Visitors will frequently observe Parisian cyclists proceeding through red lights, a behavior that appears chaotic but is often sanctioned by a specific road sign. This is the **'cédez-le-passage cycliste M12'** sign.<sup>30</sup>

This small, triangular sign is mounted *under* a traffic light. It displays a yellow bicycle and an arrow (or arrows) indicating a direction (straight, right, or left).<sup>30</sup> If this sign is present, a cyclist is permitted to proceed in the direction of the arrow *even if the main traffic light is red*.<sup>30</sup>

This is not a green light; it is a "yield" sign. The cyclist must proceed with extreme caution and *must yield priority* to all other road users who have a green light, including crossing traffic and, most importantly, pedestrians.<sup>30</sup> Understanding this sign is essential for interpreting Parisian traffic flow correctly.


### 2.3 A 'Hub-and-Spoke' Route Methodology

The cycling experience in Paris can be divided into two distinct categories: navigating on-street painted lanes amid traffic <sup>32</sup>, and gliding along protected, car-free greenways.<sup>33</sup> A successful sightseeing strategy must maximize the latter.

This report proposes a "Hub-and-Spoke" methodology for route planning.



* **The Hub:** The central "Hub" is the **Parc Rives de Seine**. This 10-hectare park, built on former expressways along the river, is a car-free zone reserved for pedestrians and cyclists.<sup>35</sup> This single, beautiful, and safe route directly connects the Eiffel Tower, the Musée d'Orsay, the Louvre, and the Île de la Cité (Notre-Dame).<sup>34</sup>
* **The Spokes:** The "Spokes" are the major, protected, North-South and East-West arteries that feed into the Hub. Key examples include the two-way protected 'piste cyclable' on the **Rue de Rivoli** <sup>32</sup> and the wide, two-way path on the **Boulevard de Sébastopol**.<sup>38</sup>

The most effective cycling strategy is to ride the shortest, most direct route from a starting point to the nearest "Spoke," follow the Spoke to the Seine, and then use the car-free "Hub" for the majority of the journey. This method minimizes interaction with traffic and transforms the transit into a scenic part of the visit.


## Section 3: The Top 10 Monuments: Approach Routes & Parking Guide

This section provides a tactical guide for the 10 most significant monuments within central Paris. The selection is based on visitor data and cultural importance.<sup>39</sup> For each monument, the guide details the best approach route, the most strategic 'arceaux' (public rack) parking zones, the nearest Vélib' stations, and, where available, secure underground garage options.

### 3.1 The Eiffel Tower

**Best Approach:** The most scenic and safest approach is via the "Hub" path: the **Parc Rives de Seine** on the Left Bank.<sup>33</sup> This car-free route provides an uninterrupted, cinematic approach to the monument. The final approach can be made from the Pont de Bir-Hakeim (which has a central protected path) <sup>44</sup> or by crossing the Pont d'Iéna.<sup>45</sup>

**Public 'Arceaux' Parking:** Public racks are in extremely high demand. The most likely locations are:



* **Primary Zone:** Along the **Avenue de Suffren**, which runs parallel to the Champ de Mars.
* **Secondary Zone:** On the **Quai Jacques Chirac** (formerly Quai Branly), near the river.<sup>46</sup>
* **Tertiary Zone:** A small number of racks exist on **Avenue Gustave Eiffel** <sup>47</sup>, but these are typically the first to be taken.

**Vélib' Stations:** This is the most reliable parking solution.



* **Station #7010 (Octave Gréard):** 2 Avenue Octave Gréard. Closest to the East Pillar entrance.<sup>48</sup>
* **Station #7009 (Quai Branly):** 2 Quai Branly. Ideal for the river approach.<sup>48</sup>
* **Station #7110 (Rapp):** 43 Avenue Rapp. A good backup option.<sup>48</sup>
* **Station #15104 (Bir Hakeim):** Near the RER station and bridge.<sup>49</sup>

**Secure Garage:** The **Saemes Quai Branly-Tour Eiffel** underground garage (25 Quai Jacques Chirac) is open 24/7 and explicitly offers dedicated bicycle parking ('velo' icon).<sup>46</sup>


### 3.2 The Louvre Museum

**Best Approach:** There are two excellent, safe approaches.



1. **The "Royal Route":** Use the protected, two-way 'piste cyclable' on the **Rue de Rivoli**.<sup>32</sup> This is a major "Spoke" and a cycling landmark in itself.
2. **The "River Route":** Use the "Hub" path on the Right Bank of the Seine, which passes directly behind the museum.<sup>34</sup>

**Public 'Arceaux' Parking:** This is a critical point: *do not* search for parking at the glass Pyramid. The official Louvre website states that the designated bicycle parking area is located near the **Porte des Lions** entrance, in front of the **École du Louvre**.<sup>52</sup> This is the most reliable zone for finding public 'arceaux'.

**Vélib' Stations:** The Louvre's official site provides a definitive list of the closest stations.<sup>52</sup>



* **Station #1015:** 2 Place André Malraux.
* **Station #1023:** 165 Rue Saint-Honoré.
* **Station #1014:** 5 Rue de l'Echelle.
* **Station #1013:** 186 Rue Saint-Honoré.

**Secure Garage:** The museum's official underground car park is located at **1 Avenue du Général Lemonier**, with access via the Galerie du Carrousel.<sup>52</sup> Alternatively, the **Parking INDIGO Pyramides** (15 Rue des Pyramides) is nearby.<sup>56</sup>


### 3.3 Arc de Triomphe

**Best Approach:** The approach must be made via the dedicated bicycle lane on the **Avenue des Champs-Élysées**.<sup>35</sup> This path is wide and generally safe, though it is often crowded with pedestrians.

**CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING:** Under no circumstances should a tourist or non-expert cyclist attempt to ride in the **Place de l'Étoile (Place Charles de Gaulle)** roundabout. It is a 12-lane, high-speed, chaotic junction with no lane markings and a 'priorité à droite' (yield to the right) rule, making it one of the most dangerous intersections in the world for automobiles, let alone bicycles.<sup>57</sup> While technically legal <sup>59</sup>, it is profoundly unsafe.

The *only* safe way to access the monument itself is to **dismount** and use the **underground pedestrian tunnel**.<sup>60</sup> While it is permissible to walk a bike through the tunnel, it involves stairs and heavy pedestrian traffic.<sup>60</sup>

**The Expert Solution:** Do not take a bicycle to the monument's base. The best strategy is to park on one of the surrounding avenues and walk.

**Public 'Arceaux' Parking:** The safest and most practical locations for 'arceaux' are on the wide sidewalks of the avenues *before* the roundabout.



* **Primary Zone:** **Avenue Hoche** or **Avenue de Wagram**.<sup>61</sup>
* **Secondary Zone:** **Avenue Carnot**.<sup>61</sup>

**Vélib' Stations:** Stations are located on the peripheral avenues, supporting this "park and walk" strategy.



* **Station #8041 (Hoche - Tilsitt):** 60 Avenue Hoche.<sup>61</sup>
* **Station #8042 (Arsène Houssaye - Champs-Elysées):** 2 Avenue Arsène Houssaye.<sup>61</sup>
* **Station #8040 (Beaujon - Wagram):** 21 Rue Beaujon.<sup>61</sup>

**Secure Garage:** Several Saemes garages are nearby and offer 'velo' (bike) parking, including **Parking George V** (101 Avenue des Champs-Élysées) and **Parking Carnot** (14bis Avenue Carnot).<sup>62</sup>


### 3.4 Notre-Dame Cathedral

**Best Approach:** The cathedral is located at "Kilometer Zero" of all French roads and is the starting point for major cycle routes like the Seine à Vélo.<sup>38</sup> The best approach is via the Seine "Hub" path.<sup>37</sup> The Left Bank path (Quai de Montebello) <sup>36</sup> offers the most iconic view. Cross at the **Pont d'Arcole** (from the Right Bank) or the **Pont au Double** (from the Left Bank).

**Public 'Arceaux' Parking:** With the cathedral's reopening, the Parvis (plaza) <sup>66</sup> will be a high-security area. Parking is concentrated on the island's periphery.



* **Primary Zone:** **Rue d'Arcole**, just north of the Parvis.<sup>68</sup>
* **Secondary Zone:** Along the **Quai aux Fleurs** on the north side of the island.<sup>69</sup>
* **Tertiary Zone:** **Place Louis Lépine** (see Sainte-Chapelle).

**Vélib' Stations:** Several stations are located on the Île de la Cité, making Vélib' an ideal choice.<sup>69</sup>



* **Station #4001 (Arcole - Notre-Dame):** 10 Rue d'Arcole. The closest option.<sup>68</sup>
* **Station #4003 (Quai aux Fleurs):** 1 Quai aux Fleurs.<sup>69</sup>
* **Station #4002 (Place Louis Lépine):** In the Cité flower market, a 3-minute walk.<sup>69</sup>

**Secure Garage:** The **Saemes Hôtel de Ville** garage (6 Quai de Gesvres) is a short walk across the Pont d'Arcole and offers 'velo' parking.<sup>74</sup>


### 3.5 Sainte-Chapelle

**Best Approach:** As Sainte-Chapelle is located on the Île de la Cité within the Palais de Justice complex, the approach is identical to that of Notre-Dame.<sup>38</sup> Use the Seine "Hub" path and cross onto the island.

**Public 'Arceaux' Parking:** Due to the high-security nature of the Palais de Justice, parking is not available directly at the entrance.



* **Primary Zone:** **Place Louis Lépine**, which hosts the flower market, is the largest open space on the island and has 'arceaux'.<sup>76</sup>
* **Secondary Zone:** Along the **Boulevard du Palais**, which runs in front of the entrance.<sup>77</sup>

**Vélib' Stations:** The stations serve both Notre-Dame and Sainte-Chapelle.<sup>78</sup>



* **Station #4002 (Place Louis Lépine):** This is the closest and most practical station, located a 1-minute walk from the entrance.<sup>73</sup>
* **Station #4001 (Arcole - Notre-Dame):** A 3-4 minute walk away.<sup>69</sup>

**Secure Garage:** **Parking INDIGO Harlay-Pont Neuf** (25 Place Dauphine) is located at the western tip of the island.<sup>56</sup> The **Saemes Hôtel de Ville** garage is also a valid option.<sup>74</sup>


### 3.6 Sacré-Cœur Basilica

**Best Approach:** This monument presents a significant topographical challenge: it sits atop the Butte Montmartre, a steep hill.<sup>81</sup> While it is possible to cycle to the top via winding streets like Rue Lepic <sup>82</sup>, this is an arduous climb.

**The Expert Solution:** The best approach is to *park at the bottom* of the hill and ascend on foot via the main stairs or by using the **funicular**, which accepts standard public transport tickets.

**Public 'Arceaux' Parking:** The entire area at the base of the hill is the designated parking zone.



* **Primary Zone:** **Place Saint-Pierre**, the large square at the base of the main staircase and the funicular.<sup>84</sup>
* **Secondary Zone:** **Rue Tardieu** <sup>85</sup> and the surrounding streets (e.g., Rue de Steinkerque).

**Vélib' Stations:** The Vélib' stations are perfectly positioned for this "park-at-the-bottom" strategy.<sup>84</sup>



* **Station #18005 (Square Louise Michel):** Located directly on Place Saint-Pierre, at the foot of the stairs.<sup>84</sup>
* **Station #18004 (Tardieu - Chappe):** Located at the base of the funicular.<sup>84</sup>
* **Station #9038 (Square d'Anvers):** A 3-minute walk away, this is a good backup if the two primary stations are full.<sup>86</sup>

**Secure Garage:** This area is not well-served by secure underground garages for bikes. The Vélib' strategy is strongly recommended.


### 3.7 Musée d'Orsay

**Best Approach:** This is one of the easiest and most pleasant monuments to reach by bike. The museum is located directly on the **Parc Rives de Seine** (Left Bank) "Hub".<sup>37</sup> The car-free path runs along the Quai Anatole-France <sup>88</sup>, bringing cyclists directly to the museum's entrance.

**Public 'Arceaux' Parking:**



* **Primary Zone:** **Rue de Lille**.<sup>89</sup> This street runs parallel to the museum, one block south, and has numerous 'arceaux'.
* **Secondary Zone:** On the **Esplanade Valéry Giscard d'Estaing** (the museum's plaza) and along the **Rue de la Légion d'Honneur**.

**Vélib' Stations:** The museum's official website provides a definitive list of the two closest stations.<sup>90</sup>



* **Station #7007:** 62 Rue de Lille.<sup>90</sup>
* **Station #7006:** 19 Quai Voltaire.<sup>90</sup>

**Secure Garage:** **Parking Bac Montalembert** (9 Rue de Montalembert) is listed by the museum as a nearby option and offers secure parking.<sup>92</sup>


### 3.8 The Panthéon

**Best Approach:** This monument requires a significant climb up the "Montagne Sainte-Geneviève" in the Latin Quarter.<sup>94</sup> The most direct and scenic approach is via the protected bike lane on **Rue Soufflot**, which begins at the Luxembourg Gardens and leads directly to the monument's plaza.<sup>95</sup>

**Public 'Arceaux' Parking:** Racks are plentiful in this student-heavy district.



* **Primary Zone:** Directly on the **Place du Panthéon** <sup>18</sup>, particularly on the east side near the **Rue Valette**.<sup>97</sup>
* **Secondary Zone:** Along the Rue Soufflot.<sup>96</sup>

**Vélib' Stations:** The Panthéon's official website provides a precise, single answer for the closest station.<sup>97</sup>



* **Station #5032 (Panthéon - Valette):** Located directly on the Place du Panthéon.<sup>97</sup>

**Secure Garage:** **Parking INDIGO Soufflot-Panthéon** (22 Rue Soufflot) is located directly on the approach path and is open 24/7.<sup>96</sup>


### 3.9 Centre Pompidou

**Best Approach:** The Centre Pompidou is best reached via one of Paris's primary "Spokes," the wide, two-way protected cycle path on the **Boulevard de Sébastopol**.<sup>38</sup> From this artery, turn onto the bike-friendly **Rue Rambuteau**, which leads directly to the museum.<sup>100</sup>

**Public 'Arceaux' Parking:** The large, open piazza in front of the museum is the main parking area.



* **Primary Zone:** **Place Georges Pompidou**. A large number of 'arceaux' are available here.<sup>102</sup>
* **Secondary Zone:** Along the Rue Rambuteau.<sup>100</sup>

**Vélib' Stations:** Stations are plentiful in this central, high-traffic area.<sup>101</sup>



* **Station #04021 (Centre Georges Pompidou):** Located at 49 Rue Rambuteau.<sup>101</sup>
* **Station #4020 (Beaubourg - Michel-le-Comte):** A very short walk away and a good backup.

**Secure Garage:** Several underground car parks in the immediate vicinity offer bike parking.



* **Parking INDIGO Centre Pompidou:** 41 Rue Rambuteau.<sup>100</sup>
* **Zenpark Parking:** 42 Rue Beaubourg.<sup>103</sup>


### 3.10 Grand Palais & Petit Palais

**Best Approach:** The two palaces face each other across the spectacular **Avenue Winston Churchill**.<sup>35</sup> The best approach is from the **Avenue des Champs-Élysées** bike lane <sup>35</sup>, turning south onto Avenue Winston Churchill. Alternatively, approach from the Seine "Hub" via the Pont Alexandre III.<sup>35</sup>

**Public 'Arceaux' Parking:**



* **Primary Zone:** Along the wide pavements of **Avenue Winston Churchill**.<sup>35</sup>
* **Secondary Zone:** On the **Cours la Reine**, the parallel road along the Seine.

**Vélib' Stations:** The Grand Palais official website explicitly lists its nearest stations.<sup>106</sup>



* **Station #8029:** Avenue Franklin D. Roosevelt.
* **Station #8001:** Avenue Dutuit (at the corner of the Palais de la Découverte).

**Secure Garage:** Several paid garages are in the area, including **Parking INDIGO Place de la Concorde** and **Parc François-1er**.<sup>106</sup>


## Section 4: Curated Itineraries & Final Recommendations

This analysis of routes and parking logistics synthesizes into several clear, actionable itineraries. The following plans are designed to be safe, efficient, and to maximize the scenic potential of cycling in Paris, all built around the "Hub-and-Spoke" methodology.


### 4.1 Three Perfect Days on Two Wheels



* **Route 1: The Seine River Run (Easy; approx. 10-12 km)**
    * **Theme:** This is the essential, safest, and most beautiful route, utilizing the car-free "Hub" path along the Seine.<sup>33</sup>
    * **Itinerary:** Begin at the **Eiffel Tower**. Follow the Left Bank car-free path east to the **Musée d'Orsay**. Continue to the Île de la Cité to visit **Notre-Dame** and **Sainte-Chapelle**. Cross to the Right Bank and conclude at the **Louvre**. This entire route is almost 100% segregated from automobile traffic.
* **Route 2: The Right Bank Icons (Moderate; approx. 12-15 km)**
    * **Theme:** This route utilizes the main protected "Spoke" arteries, including the Champs-Élysées, Rue de Rivoli, and Boulevard de Sébastopol.<sup>32</sup>
    * **Itinerary:** Begin by parking near the **Arc de Triomphe** (on Av. Hoche). Cycle down the Champs-Élysées path to the **Grand Palais**. Cross Place de la Concorde (dismount if necessary) to join the Rue de Rivoli path. Follow this to the **Louvre**, then continue on the protected axes to the **Centre Pompidou**.
* **Route 3: The Climber's Challenge (Hard; approx. 8 km)**
    * **Theme:** This route is for fit and ambitious cyclists, tackling the two major hills of the Left and Right Banks.<sup>82</sup>
    * **Itinerary:** Begin in the Latin Quarter. Ascend the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève via Rue Soufflot to the **Panthéon**. Navigate north through the city (using Géovélo for the safest route). Arrive at the base of Montmartre, dock at Vélib' station #18005 (Square Louise Michel), and walk up to the **Sacré-Cœur**.


### 4.2 Concluding Golden Rules: A Final Strategic Checklist



1. **Trust Digital Tools:** Use the **Géovélo** app for route planning and locating 'arceaux'.<sup>4</sup> Use the **Vélib' Métropole** app to check dock availability in real-time.<sup>10</sup>
2. **Embrace Vélib':** The Vélib' system is the optimal solution for tourists. It functions as both bicycle and secure parking, completely eliminating the risk of theft.<sup>9</sup>
3. **Secure Personal Bikes:** If using a personal bike, a high-quality U-Lock (Sold Secure Gold or ART 3) is mandatory.<sup>14</sup> Always lock the frame to a fixed 'arceau'.<sup>17</sup>
4. **Master the Hub:** The car-free **Parc Rives de Seine** is the primary artery.<sup>33</sup> Use it as the backbone for all sightseeing journeys.
5. **Know the Risk Zones:** **Never** attempt to cycle the Place de l'Étoile roundabout.<sup>57</sup> The safest strategy for **Sacré-Cœur** is to park at the base and walk or use the funicular.<sup>83</sup>
6. **Adhere to Core Laws:** Bicycles are **forbidden** on the Métro.<sup>21</sup> Cycling with **headphones** is illegal.<sup>12</sup> **Pedestrians always have priority**.<sup>12</sup>
