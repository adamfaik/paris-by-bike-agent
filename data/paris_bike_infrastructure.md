# An Expert Analysis of Parisian Cycling Infrastructure, Policy, and Use


## Section 1: The Strategic Vision: Paris 'Plan Vélo' 2021-2026

The city of Paris is currently engaged in a profound transformation of its urban mobility, guided by the ambitious 'Plan Vélo 2021-2026'. This municipal strategy aims to create a "100% cyclable" city, representing a shift from merely accommodating bicycles to actively prioritizing them as a central mode of transport.<sup>1</sup>


### 1.1 Core Ambition: The "100% Cyclable" City

The plan's ambition extends far beyond the simple construction of lanes. It is designed to establish a comprehensive "vélo écosystème" (bicycle ecosystem) <sup>2</sup> and to "développer une culture vélo" (develop a bicycle culture).<sup>1</sup> This holistic approach integrates infrastructure with a suite of "soft" policies, including:



* **Education:** The generalization of the "Savoir Rouler à l'école" program, which aims to teach all Parisian schoolchildren how to cycle safely and confidently.<sup>3</sup>
* **Financial Incentives:** Continued and reformed "Aides à l'écomobilité," providing subsidies for the purchase of electric-assist (VAE) and mechanical bicycles.<sup>3</sup>
* **Economic Integration:** The formal development of "cyclologistique" (cargo-bike logistics) to support and decarbonize last-mile deliveries.<sup>3</sup>


### 1.2 Quantitative Goals: Infrastructure and Parking

The strategy is underpinned by significant quantitative targets for both network expansion and parking.



* **Network Expansion:** The plan's primary infrastructure goal is the creation of 180 km of new, secured cycle lanes.<sup>3</sup> This 180 km target is a composite figure:
    * **130 km of entirely new, secured pistes** (dedicated cycle tracks).<sup>2</sup>
    * **52 km of 'pistes pérennisées'** (made permanent).<sup>2</sup> This component involves upgrading the "coronapistes"—temporary pop-up lanes established during the 2020 public health crisis—into permanent, "hard" infrastructure with physical separators.
* **Neighborhood Access:** Separate from the main arteries, the plan mandates the creation of **390 km of 'doubles-sens cyclables'**.<sup>2</sup> These are contraflow lanes that make low-speed residential and commercial streets permeable by bicycle, even when they are one-way for motor vehicles.
* **Parking:** The plan calls for the creation of over **130,000 new bicycle parking spaces** to address the critical issue of storage and theft.<sup>4</sup>

This dual-network strategy—building 180 km of high-security arterial routes while simultaneously opening 390 km of fine-grained neighborhood access—is designed to make any journey in Paris safe and efficient by bicycle. The 180 km goal itself reveals a hybrid planning model: it combines proactive, long-term construction (the 130 km) with a reactive, agile legitimization of tactical urbanism (the 52 km of "coronapistes").

Furthermore, the 130,000-space parking target is a prime example of a leveraged policy. Municipal documents clarify that only "30,000 nouveaux arceaux" (new public racks) are planned for installation in the public realm.<sup>1</sup> The vast majority of the 130,000-space goal is intended to be met through legislation—specifically, "Obligations de stationnement sécurisés" (mandatory secure parking) imposed on all new construction or major renovations of private residences, offices, and public-facing establishments.<sup>1</sup> In this model, the city uses its planning regulations (PLU) to compel the private market to fund and build the remaining 100,000+ spaces, dramatically reducing the direct cost to the public purse.


### 1.3 Independent Assessment & Progress (as of June 2025)

Progress on these ambitious goals is monitored by independent bodies, notably the *Observatoire du Plan Vélo* (Paris Bicycle Plan Observatory). As of June 1, 2025, with 93% of the 2020-2026 municipal mandate elapsed, the Observatory's analysis indicates that **only 37% of the 'Plan Vélo' has been realized**.<sup>5</sup>

This 37% realization rate breaks down as follows <sup>5</sup>:



* **28.6 km** of new lanes completed (of the 130 km goal).
* **38.5 km** of temporary lanes upgraded with "hard" permanent infrastructure.
* **4.6 km** of temporary lanes given "light" permanent upgrades.

This data reveals a critical bottleneck. While the city has been relatively successful in upgrading existing temporary lanes—achieving approximately 74% of its 52 km "pérennisées" goal (38.5 km / 52 km)—it has fallen significantly behind on its new-build agenda, completing only 22% of the 130 km target (28.6 km / 130 km). This disparity strongly suggests that the political and logistical challenges of building brand-new, separated infrastructure (which often involves reallocating road space from motor vehicles) are far greater than those of upgrading "soft" infrastructure that already exists.


## Section 2: The Parisian Bicycle Network: City and Métropole

A cyclist navigating Paris must understand two distinct, superimposed network systems: the dense municipal network for local access and the high-speed regional network for distance and commuting.


### 2.1 The Parisian Network (Plan Vélo)

This is the fine-grained *intra-muros* network funded and managed by the Mairie de Paris under the 'Plan Vélo'.<sup>6</sup> Its primary focus is on "last-mile" connectivity and making all destinations within the city reachable by bike.

The most transformative component of this network, in terms of sheer mileage, is the **390 km of 'doubles-sens cyclables' (DSC)**.<sup>2</sup> The implementation of DSCs (contraflow lanes) in nearly all 30 km/h zones fundamentally rewires the city's one-way street system. For a car, this system is a labyrinth designed to frustrate cross-town journeys. For a cyclist, the DSCs turn this labyrinth into a fully permeable grid, enabling shorter, more direct, and safer journeys by avoiding major, high-traffic arteries.<sup>6</sup>


### 2.2 The Regional Network: RER-V / VIF (Réseau Vélo Île-de-France)

This is a separate, regional-scale "express" network, formerly known by its advocacy name, the RER-V (Réseau Express Régional Vélo) <sup>7</sup>, and now officially adopted as the VIF (Réseau Vélo Île-de-France).<sup>7</sup>



* **Concept:** The network is explicitly modeled on the RER (Réseau Express Régional) public train system. It is not intended for local trips but to connect the *grands pôles* (major hubs) of the Île-de-France region, linking Paris to its suburbs and the suburbs to each other.<sup>7</sup>
* **Scale:** It is a massive undertaking, comprising **9 main lines** and totaling **650 km** in length.<sup>7</sup>
* **Design Principles:** As an express network, it is designed around four core principles distinct from the municipal network: **Continuity** (no breaks at intersections), **Capacity** (wide enough for cargo bikes and overtaking), **Efficiency** (clear signage, fewer stops), and **Safety** (high-quality, continuous separation).<sup>7</sup>

The origin of this regional network is a significant example of successful civic advocacy. The concept was not a top-down government directive but a grassroots proposal from the "Collectif Vélo Île-de-France," a federation of 42 local cycling associations.<sup>7</sup> This collective created a brand (RER-V) and a plan so logical and compelling that it was formally adopted and funded by the regional <sup>8</sup> and metropolitan <sup>9</sup> authorities, demonstrating the mature and influential role of advocacy groups in shaping state-level infrastructure policy.


## Section 3: A Typology of Parisian Cycleways and Their Signage

Understanding the hierarchy of cycling infrastructure is essential for safe navigation. Parisian technical guides detail a precise typology, each with specific road markings and legal signage.


### 3.1 Pistes Cyclables (Dedicated, Separated Tracks)

This is the highest-quality, safest form of infrastructure.



* **Definition:** A roadway exclusively reserved for cycles and *physically separated* from the general motor traffic roadway.<sup>10</sup>
* **Physical Separation:** The separation is structural, achieved via a curb, concrete barrier, row of bollards, or a vegetated median.<sup>10</sup> Parisian guides specify separator widths (e.g., 0.50 m minimum).<sup>11</sup>
* **Dimensions:** Standards recommend a width of 2.00 m for unidirectional tracks (1.50 m minimum) and 3.00 m for bidirectional tracks (2.50 m minimum). Wide bidirectional tracks may feature a central dashed line to separate opposing cycle traffic.<sup>10</sup>
* **Signage:** This is a crucial, specific policy choice in Paris. The city *avoids* using the **round blue B22a sign** (which would make the lane mandatory). Instead, it overwhelmingly favors the **square blue C113 sign (advisory)**.<sup>11</sup> This policy empowers cyclists, legally permitting them to leave the track and "take the lane" in general traffic if the *piste* is blocked or unsafe.
* **Markings:** The track is marked with large white bicycle logos at its entrance and repeated at maximum 50-meter intervals. A "framed" bicycle logo may be used at the entrance to more strongly characterize the track's exclusivity.<sup>11</sup>


### 3.2 Bandes Cyclables (Painted Lanes)

This infrastructure offers legal, but not physical, protection.



* **Definition:** A lane reserved for cyclists *on* the main roadway, separated from motor traffic only by a painted line.<sup>11</sup>
* **Markings:** A solid continuous white line <sup>14</sup> and bicycle logos.<sup>11</sup>
* **Parisian Innovation: The "Bande décalée"** (Offset Lane). The Parisian technical guides show a deep, iterative learning process, evidenced by this design. When a bande cyclable runs alongside a lane of parked cars, the guide mandates an "offset lane." This design inserts a **neutralized "door" zone** (0.50 m minimum, 0.70 m recommended) between the parking and the cycle lane, typically marked with chevrons. This is a specific, engineered solution to "dooring," one of the most common and dangerous urban cycling accidents.<sup>11</sup>


### 3.3 Couloirs de Bus (Shared Bus Lanes)

Cyclists are *not* permitted in all bus lanes.



* **Definition:** A lane reserved for buses and other authorized vehicles (taxis, etc.).<sup>11</sup>
* **Rule:** Authorization for bicycles is **not default**. A cyclist may *only* enter a bus lane if the vertical square blue bus sign is accompanied by a smaller sign (a *panneau M9v2*) **explicitly displaying a bicycle pictogram**.<sup>15</sup>
* **Safety:** The City of Paris explicitly warns: "contrary to popular belief, not all are authorized".<sup>16</sup> In authorized lanes, cyclists must be cautious and are legally required to yield to buses pulling out from a stop.<sup>16</sup>


### 3.4 Specialized Routes: Double-Sens Cyclables (DSC)

These are the cornerstone of the neighborhood permeability network.



* **Definition:** A contraflow lane, allowing cyclists to travel in two directions on a street that is one-way for motor vehicles.<sup>6</sup>
* **Markings:** The marking varies by road speed and width. In 30 km/h zones, it is often just logos and arrows painted on the road ("Marquage Non Séparatif"). On busier streets, it may be a full bande cyclable (painted lane) separated by a T3 dashed line.<sup>17</sup>
* **Signage:** Indicated by a C24a or C24c sign at the street's entrance, which shows a one-way sign for cars alongside a two-way arrow for bikes.<sup>17</sup>

## Section 4: The Cyclist Support Ecosystem: Maintenance and Repair

The city's infrastructure plan is supported by a growing ecosystem of maintenance and repair services, which are characterized by a "do-it-yourself" and solidarity-based model.


### 4.1 Public Access Points: Air Pumps and Repair Terminals

Publicly accessible air pumps are not typically found as standalone units. Instead, the city has pursued an efficient "piggyback" strategy, integrating them into other infrastructure.



* **Location 1: Secure Bike Shelters (Abris Vélos).** This is the primary and most common source. The new on-street secure parking boxes (often called "Vélobox") are each equipped with a **public-access air pump on the exterior** of the unit. These are free to use by any cyclist, 24/7, not just subscribers to the shelter.<sup>18</sup> This model is highly efficient: it makes the pump's location predictable (wherever the shelters are) and bundles its maintenance into the shelter's service contract, reducing vandalism and upkeep costs.
* **Location 2: Vélostations.** The large, high-capacity secure parking hubs located at major train stations (e.g., Gare de Lyon, Gare Montparnasse) include a "Poste de gonflage et d'outillage" (Inflating and tool station) for use by subscribers within the secure area.<sup>19</sup>
* **Location 3: Other Terminals.** Some private companies <sup>20</sup> and adjacent municipalities <sup>21</sup> are also installing standalone repair and pump terminals on public or private land.


### 4.2 Participatory Repair Workshops (Ateliers d'auto-réparation)

Beyond simple inflation, the dominant repair model in Paris is not commercial but participatory. The city hosts an extensive network of "ateliers d'auto-réparation" (self-repair workshops).<sup>22</sup>



* **Model:** These are not shops. They are association-run workshops where individuals repair their *own* bicycles ("auto-réparation") using tools and space provided by the association. Volunteers and salaried mechanics are present to teach and assist, but not to perform the repair for the user.<sup>22</sup>
* **Philosophy:** This model is designed to empower cyclists, teach self-sufficiency, lower the financial barrier to cycling, and build a resilient community. It is a social infrastructure, not just a service network, and aligns directly with the "culture vélo" goal of the Plan Vélo.<sup>1</sup>
* **Network & Pricing:** The network is widespread, with varying access models.<sup>22</sup>
    * **Le réseau Solicycle (Paris Centre, 14e, 18e):** Requires an annual membership (e.g., €20) and is run by people in social integration programs.<sup>22</sup>
    * **Vélocip'aide (17e):** A solidarity-focused model with free admission, where users contribute what they can for parts.<sup>22</sup>
    * **Les Cyclofficines (20e):** A self-managed association operating on a "prix libre" (free pricing) model, where each member determines what they should pay.<sup>22</sup>
    * **Itinerant Workshops:** Organizations like **Cyclocube** operate mobile, pop-up workshops at various locations (e.g., squares, markets, cultural centers) across the city.<sup>22</sup>

## Section 5: Bicycle Parking & Storage: Regulations and Solutions

Bicycle parking is a critical component of the city's strategy, governed by new, strict regulations and supported by a multi-layered infrastructure market.


### 5.1 Municipal Parking Regulations: The 'Code de la rue'

A major policy shift occurred with the adoption of the Parisian "Code de la rue" (Code of the Street) in July 2023.<sup>25</sup>



* **The Sidewalk Prohibition:** This new code's primary goal is to restore the sidewalk as a sanctuary for pedestrians. It establishes a **"zero-tolerance objective for violations on sidewalks"**.<sup>25</sup> This zero-tolerance policy *explicitly* includes a prohibition on parking or riding bicycles on the sidewalk.<sup>25</sup>
* **Specialized Rules:**
    * **Free-Floating Bikes:** Shared, dockless bicycles (e.g., Vélib', Dott) have specific rules. As of October 2025, they *must* be parked in designated bicycle parking zones (either with or without arceaux, or racks).<sup>19</sup>
    * **Cargo Bikes:** Reflecting their growing role in logistics, cargo bikes are granted a special privilege: they are allowed to park for free in the paid car-parking lane (*bande de stationnement payant*).<sup>1</sup> This is part of a forward-looking policy to future-proof the city's infrastructure for new bicycle types.

The city's "zero-tolerance" policy on sidewalk parking creates a significant regulatory tension. This policy is only viable and fair if a massive, convenient, and available alternative is provided. This makes the successful and rapid rollout of the 30,000 new arceaux <sup>1</sup> and the secure Vélobox network (detailed below) not just a convenience, but a prerequisite for the 'Code de la rue' to function without simply punishing cyclists for a behavior (sidewalk parking) that is a direct symptom of an infrastructure shortage.


### 5.2 Public and Secure Parking Infrastructure: A Hierarchy of Solutions

To meet the new demand, the city has fostered a competitive, multi-layered "market of solutions" for parking, run by various public and private operators. This provides a range of options based on security, duration, and cost.



* **Level 1: Public Racks (Arceaux)**
    * These are the standard, unsecured metal hoops on sidewalks and in public squares. This is the 30,000-space goal of the 'Plan Vélo'.<sup>1</sup> They are free but offer minimal security.
* **Level 2: On-Street Secure Shelters (Abris vélos / Vélobox)**
    * These are locked, metal boxes, typically holding 6 bikes, installed on the street, often replacing a single car-parking space.<sup>26</sup>
    * **Access:** 24/7 via smartphone app or badge.
    * **Cost:** Subscription-based, approximately €75 per year.<sup>19</sup>
* **Level 3: High-Capacity Secure Hubs (Vélostations / Consignes)**
    * These are large-scale, secure parking facilities or lockers located at major transport hubs (Gare de Lyon, Gare Montparnasse, Gare de l'Est, etc.).<sup>19</sup>
    * **Example:** The largest in the region opened at Gare du Nord in June 2024, offering 1,186 secure spaces.<sup>19</sup>
    * **Operator/Cost:** Many are run by Île-de-France Mobilités (IDFM). Access is often **free with an annual Navigo pass** (public transport pass), or available via a low-cost subscription (e.g., €30 per year).<sup>19</sup>
* **Level 4: Private Underground Parking**
    * Major underground car park operators (e.g., Indigo, Saemes) now offer dedicated, secure bike zones with badge access.<sup>19</sup>
    * **Cost:** Monthly or annual subscription, typically ranging from €10 to €20 per month or around €75 per year.<sup>19</sup>

## Section 6: Best Practices for Bicycle Security and Theft Prevention

Bicycle theft remains a significant problem. A robust, multi-layered security strategy is essential. Analysis of municipal <sup>31</sup>, police <sup>32</sup>, and advocacy group <sup>33</sup> recommendations reveals an unambiguous consensus on best practices.


### 6.1 The '5 Golden Rules' of Anti-Theft

The Fédération française des Usagères et Usagers de la Bicyclette (FUB) outlines "5 règles d'or" (5 golden rules) that form the basis of all sound security advice.<sup>33</sup>



* **Rule 1: Buy a *Good* Lock.**
    * This means a high-quality **U-lock (antivol U)**. Cable locks are explicitly discouraged as being "easy to cut".<sup>31</sup>
    * The lock should be certified by a recognized body, such as the FUB "2 roues" ❂❂ rating, the Dutch ART "* *" rating, or the British "Sold Secure Gold" rating.<sup>33</sup>
    * Expect to invest at least €30, or up to 15% of the bicycle's value. For high-risk areas, a second U-lock is recommended.<sup>33</sup>
* **Rule 2: *Always* Lock Your Bike.**
    * Theft is opportunistic. Bikes must be locked "even for a short duration".<sup>33</sup>
    * Crucially, this applies "even indoors," as one in two thefts occurs at home (e.g., in cellars, garages, or building hallways).<sup>33</sup>
* **Rule 3: Attach the *Frame* and *a Wheel* to a *Fixed Point*.**
    * This is the most critical technical skill. A lock is useless if applied incorrectly. The Mairie de Paris emphasizes: **"Attach the frame to a fixed point"**.<sup>31</sup>
    * The U-lock must capture three things:
        1. Your **bicycle frame** (the most valuable part).
        2. A **fixed, solid object** (an arceau or solid railing that cannot be cut or lifted).
        3. Ideally, the **rear wheel**, which is more expensive than the front.<sup>34</sup>
    * A secondary cable or smaller U-lock can then be used to secure the front wheel to the frame.<sup>33</sup>
    * *Technique:* Keep the U-lock high off the ground (making leverage attacks difficult) and position the keyhole facing down (protecting it from picking and debris).<sup>33</sup>
* **Rule 4: Get Your Bike *Marked* ('Marquage').**
    * This is a critical second layer of defense. Since January 2021, marking is mandatory for all new bicycles sold by professionals in France.<sup>31</sup>
    * Marking involves engraving a unique ID number (e.g., 'Bicycode') onto the bike's frame and registering it in a national database accessible to law enforcement.<sup>32</sup>
    * This acts as a powerful deterrent (a marked bike is difficult to re-sell) and is the only effective way for police to return a recovered stolen bike to its rightful owner.<sup>33</sup>
* **Rule 5: Protect Your Components.**
    * Wheels and saddles, especially those with quick-release levers, are common targets. These should be replaced with anti-theft axles or locking bolts that require a unique key.<sup>33</sup>

Security is not a single product but a layered system. An effective strategy combines:



1. **Prevention:** The right lock (U-lock) and the right *technique* (frame-to-wheel-to-fixed-point).<sup>31</sup>
2. **Deterrence/Recovery:** Bike *marking* to make it a less attractive target and recoverable if stolen.<sup>31</sup>
3. **Environment:** Using the most secure *parking* available (e.g., a secure Vélobox or Vélostation from Section 5).<sup>19</sup>
4. **Mitigation:** Theft *insurance* as a final backstop, especially for high-value electric bikes.<sup>31</sup>


## Section 7: Conclusions

This analysis of Paris's bicycle infrastructure reveals a city in the midst of a deliberate, if challenging, transition. The strategic vision is both comprehensive and sophisticated, aiming to build not just a network, but a self-sustaining culture.

The primary conclusions of this report are:



1. **A Dual-Network Strategy:** Paris's cycling transformation is built on two distinct systems: the municipal 'Plan Vélo' <sup>2</sup>, which focuses on neighborhood permeability via contraflow lanes, and the regional RER-V/VIF <sup>7</sup>, which provides a high-speed "express" network for commuters. Understanding this dual structure is fundamental to navigating the city.
2. **Mature, Iterative Design:** The city's technical standards and support services demonstrate a mature, data-driven approach. Innovations like the "bande décalée" (offset "door" zone lane) <sup>11</sup>, the preference for "advisory" (C113) over "mandatory" lanes <sup>11</sup>, the "piggyback" model for public air pumps <sup>19</sup>, and the cultivation of a self-repair workshop network <sup>22</sup> all show a system that learns from real-world problems and iterates solutions.
3. **The Implementation Gap:** A significant gap persists between the 'Plan Vélo 2021-2026' ambitions and its on-the-ground realization.<sup>5</sup> The completion of new, separated infrastructure is the plan's primary bottleneck, highlighting the immense political and logistical difficulty of reallocating space from motor vehicles.
4. **A Central Regulatory Tension:** The city's most significant unresolved challenge lies in the tension between its new parking regulations and its infrastructure rollout. The "Code de la rue" <sup>25</sup> has, justifiably, banned sidewalk parking to protect pedestrians. However, this "zero-tolerance" policy is entirely contingent on the rapid and successful deployment of the 30,000 public arceaux and the secure Vélobox network. Given the current delays in the plan's execution, the city risks being in a position of punishing cyclists for a behavior that is a direct symptom of its own infrastructure shortage. The resolution of this tension will be a key determinant of the 'Plan Vélo's' ultimate success.
