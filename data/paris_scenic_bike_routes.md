# The Connoisseur's Guide to Cycling Paris: A Landmark-by-Landmark Report


## I. Introduction: The Parisian Cycling Renaissance


### Preamble: A City Transformed

Paris, a city once defined by its grand boulevards congested with traffic and the subterranean hum of its Métro, has undergone a profound metamorphosis. In the 21st century, the true connoisseur's method of exploration is no longer by tour bus or taxi, but from the saddle of a bicycle. Cycling has evolved from a simple mode of transport into the premier method for experiential tourism, offering an intimate, ground-level, and self-paced engagement with the city's monumental beauty and living, breathing neighborhoods. This transformation is not a happy accident; it is the result of one of the most ambitious urban mobility strategies in the world.


### The Political and Social Drivers

The Parisian cycling renaissance is the product of deliberate and aggressive political will. At its core is the "Plan Velo: Act 2" (2021-2026), a €250 million investment championed by Mayor Anne Hidalgo with the explicit goal of making Paris "100% bikeable" by 2026.<sup>1</sup> This plan aims to build a complete, continuous, and secure cycling network.

While the "Plan Velo" provided the blueprint, two major societal disruptions served as powerful, unplanned accelerants. The widespread transport strikes of 2019 and the global pandemic of 2020 forced Parisians to find alternatives to crowded public transport.<sup>1</sup> In response, the city rapidly deployed over 50 kilometers of temporary bike-only lanes, famously dubbed "coronapistes".<sup>1</sup> The public adoption of these routes was so immediate and overwhelming that many were subsequently made permanent, cementing a new geography for the city.<sup>1</sup>

As a result, Paris now boasts a network of more than 1,000 kilometers of bike paths and lanes.<sup>2</sup> This extensive infrastructure has fundamentally altered the city's "liveability" <sup>1</sup> and has rendered obsolete the old reputation of Paris as being "too dangerous" for cycling.<sup>6</sup>


### The Olympic Legacy: A Network Engineered for Tourists

A crucial, non-obvious development for the visiting cyclist was the 2024 Olympic Games. The logistical necessity of connecting competition venues became a catalyst for creating a tourist-perfect infrastructure. The city constructed 60 kilometers of new cycle paths, dubbed "OlympiPistes," specifically to link all the games' venues.<sup>7</sup>

This project followed a clear and beneficial logic for visitors:



1. Olympic venues, such as the Parc des Princes, the Stade de France, and the central arenas at Place de la Concorde, needed to be connected.<sup>7</sup>
2. These venues are, by their nature, located near or are themselves major city landmarks.
3. Therefore, the city's solution was to build high-quality, permanent cycle paths that directly link these monuments.<sup>7</sup>

The "legacy" of the games <sup>7</sup> is a network of safe, well-signed routes purpose-built for the exact kind of sightseeing a tourist desires. The investment in the Olympics was, in effect, an investment in a world-class, monument-to-monument cycling network.


### A Note on Parisian Cycling (Expert Advisory)

While Paris is more cycle-friendly than ever <sup>5</sup>, it demands an alert and informed cyclist. Before setting out, consider the following:



* **Navigational Tools:** Utilize the official city bike maps, which are extensive and up-to-date.<sup>2</sup> The Vélib' bike-share app is also invaluable for finding stations and e-bikes.<sup>8</sup>
* **Safety and Etiquette:** The biggest hazards are often not cars, but unaware pedestrians stepping into the bike path and fast, "sketchy" delivery drivers on mopeds or e-bikes.<sup>6</sup> Cycle defensively and assume others are not aware of their surroundings.
* **The "Priority à Droite":** Be acutely aware of this unique French traffic rule, where vehicles (and sometimes bikes) entering an intersection from the right have priority, even on smaller streets. It is a counter-intuitive and dangerous rule for the uninitiated.<sup>6</sup>
* **The Place de l'Étoile (Arc de Triomphe):** Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to cycle this chaotic, 12-lane roundabout for sightseeing. While it may be "doable" for a "former crit. racer" <sup>6</sup>, it is not a "fun" or safe experience.<sup>6</sup> The purpose of sightseeing is defeated by the sheer terror. Use the nearby tunnels or the protected lanes on the outer blocks to navigate around this junction.<sup>6</sup>

## III. Route 1: The Monumental Heart – The Seine Riverbanks (Parc Rives de Seine)


### Route Profile



* **Name:** The Seine Riverbanks (Parc Rives de Seine / Voies sur Berge)
* **Approximate Distance:** 10 km (Loop)
* **Difficulty:** Easy


### Route Description

This is the crown jewel of Parisian cycling, an experience that was unimaginable just 15 years ago. The route utilizes the *Parc Rives de Seine*, a 10-hectare park <sup>4</sup> created by permanently closing former riverside expressways to traffic and dedicating them to pedestrians and cyclists.<sup>4</sup> This "traffic-free promenade," also known as the *Voies sur Berge* <sup>10</sup>, runs along both banks of the river.

The path is "iconic and relaxing" <sup>10</sup>, almost entirely flat, wide, and completely segregated from cars <sup>5</sup>, making it ideal for all skill levels, including families.

It is important to clarify the various "Seine" routes. While "La Seine à Vélo" is the 400km+ long-distance brand for the route from Paris to the sea <sup>11</sup>, and the official "Parc Rives de Seine" is a 7km park <sup>13</sup>, the *ideal tourist route* is a 10-km loop <sup>15</sup> that encompasses the best of this park. This loop allows for a continuous, monument-filled journey through the heart of the city.


### Landmark-by-Landmark Itinerary (The Left Bank - ***Rive Gauche***)

This itinerary begins on the Left Bank, heading east.



* **Start: Pont d'Iéna (Eiffel Tower):** Begin at the foot of the bridge connecting to the Trocadéro. This starting point offers unparalleled, direct views of the **Eiffel Tower** and the sprawling lawns of the **Champ de Mars**.<sup>10</sup>
* **Pont de l'Alma:** At this bridge, you descend onto the 2.3-kilometer pedestrian-only "Berges de Seine" path <sup>17</sup>, the heart of the car-free zone.
* **Pont Alexandre III:** Cycle directly beneath the most ornate and extravagant bridge in Paris, a "masterpiece of Beaux-Arts architecture" <sup>10</sup> with its gilded statues of nymphs and pegasi.
* **Musée d'Orsay:** Glide past the magnificent former Beaux-Arts railway station, now housing the world's premier collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. The path passes directly in front of it.<sup>9</sup>
* **Pont des Arts:** Pass the famous former "love lock" bridge, a pedestrian-only span connecting the **Institut de France** with the Louvre.


### Landmark-by-Landmark Itinerary (The Right Bank - ***Rive Droite***)

After reaching the eastern end of the park, cross the river to return west along the Right Bank.



* **Île de la Cité:** The route offers spectacular views of the historic island, the cradle of Paris. You will see the restored scaffolding and spires of the **Cathédrale de Notre-Dame** <sup>10</sup>, as well as the towers of the **Conciergerie** (a former royal palace and prison) and the spire of **Sainte-Chapelle**.
* **Hôtel de Ville (City Hall):** The path passes the magnificent, massive Renaissance-revival City Hall.<sup>15</sup>
* **The Louvre:** This stretch offers one of the grandest views in Paris. You will cycle along the Right Bank with the imposing, sprawling palace of the **Louvre Museum** directly to your side.<sup>10</sup>
* **Jardin des Tuileries & Place de la Concorde:** The path continues past the formal Tuileries Gardens, leading towards the **Place de la Concorde** with its iconic obelisk.<sup>6</sup>
* **Return:** Complete the loop by cycling past the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, ultimately crossing back over the Seine at Pont d'Iéna to finish where you began.


## IV. Route 2: The Bohemian Waterways – Canal Saint-Martin & Bassin de la Villette


### Route Profile



* **Name:** The Canals (Saint-Martin, Villette, Ourcq)
* **Approximate Distance:** 7 km (One-way, from Bastille to Parc de la Villette)
* **Difficulty:** Easy


### Route Description

If the Seine is Paris's grand, monumental artery, the canals represent its bohemian, living soul. This route, designated "Parisians' Paris" <sup>18</sup>, is a "pleasant" and "stress-free ride" <sup>18</sup> that follows the water north from the Bastille area. It offers a fascinating sociological narrative, allowing the cyclist to ride through the city's changing history. The journey begins in the historic 12th arrondissement, moves through the trendy, gentrifying 10th <sup>19</sup>, and concludes in the architecturally modern 19th.<sup>19</sup>

The cycle paths are largely separated from traffic, running alongside the canal quays or on wide, tree-lined esplanades where the canal runs underground.<sup>18</sup>


### Landmark-by-Landmark Itinerary



* **Start: Port de l'Arsenal:** The route begins at this picturesque urban marina, where the Canal Saint-Martin flows into the Seine. It is situated directly adjacent to the **Place de la Bastille**, marked by its towering "July Column".<sup>18</sup>
* **Opéra Bastille:** As you begin, the path passes the "huge steel and glass building" of the modern opera house.<sup>18</sup>
* **Boulevard Richard-Lenoir:** The canal immediately goes underground. The route continues over it, along a wide, covered central esplanade. This park-like strip is a hub of local life, dotted with squares, bustling food markets (like the Bastille market), and *boules* pitches.<sup>18</sup>
* **The Resurfaced Canal (Quai de Jemmapes):** Near the **Place de la République** <sup>18</sup>, the canal emerges from underground, and the route enters its most iconic phase. This section, a favorite haunt for picnicking Parisians <sup>18</sup>, is famous for:
    * **Historic Locks:** You can admire the canal's double locks and wait to see a barge or sightseeing boat pass beneath the bridges.<sup>18</sup>
    * **Iron Footbridges:** A series of charming, elevated green iron footbridges span the water, defining the canal's aesthetic.
    * **Hôtel du Nord:** A little further on is this landmark, immortalized in Marcel Carné's classic 1938 film, an icon of "Old Paris".<sup>18</sup>
    * **"Amélie" Bridge:** The route crosses the small bridge fronting Rue Léon Jouhaux, where the heroine of the film *Amélie* famously skimmed stones.<sup>18</sup>
* **Place de la Bataille de Stalingrad:** The route navigates this busy intersection <sup>19</sup>, which features the beautiful **Rotonde de la Villette**, a neoclassical former customs house now housing a bar and restaurant.<sup>18</sup>
* **Bassin de la Villette:** The canal opens into this wide, 19th-century basin, the largest artificial lake in Paris. The route skirts its edge, another popular spot for locals in summer and a key location for the "Paris Plages" event.<sup>18</sup>
* **Parc de la Villette:** The path flows seamlessly into this 55-hectare futuristic park, a "park of the 21st century." It is dotted with artworks, large green expanses, and imposing modern buildings <sup>18</sup>, including:
    * **Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie:** One of Europe's largest science museums.<sup>18</sup>
    * **La Géode:** The iconic, mirror-finished spherical cinema building.<sup>18</sup>
    * **Philharmonie de Paris:** The striking, metallic concert hall designed by Jean Nouvel.<sup>18</sup>
* **Extension (Canal de l'Ourcq):** This route does not have to end here. The cycle path continues from Parc de la Villette for over 30 kilometers along the Canal de l'Ourcq <sup>18</sup>, past old factories <sup>21</sup> and into green spaces like the Parc de la Poudrerie.<sup>20</sup>


## V. Route 3: The Western Oasis – The Forests and Gardens of Bois de Boulogne


### Route Profile



* **Name:** The Bois de Boulogne Loop
* **Approximate Distance:** 11-15 km (Loop)
* **Difficulty:** Easy to Moderate (The park itself is Easy; the ride from the city center adds a Moderate element)


### Route Description

This route provides a "country cycle ride in the west of Paris".<sup>10</sup> At over 850 hectares <sup>22</sup>, the Bois de Boulogne is a vast "oasis of greenery" <sup>22</sup> and a former royal hunting ground.<sup>22</sup> It represents "High Paris," a complex mix of high culture, serious athletic pursuits, and quiet family leisure. The park is crisscrossed with 15 kilometers of dedicated cycle paths <sup>22</sup>, allowing for a varied exploration.

While the park itself is easy to navigate, a tourist needs a curated route. The one detailed here begins at the **Arc de Triomphe** <sup>22</sup>, following the grand *Avenue de la Grande Armée* to **Porte Maillot**, a main entrance to the park.<sup>22</sup>

It should be noted that while the park is a beautiful leisure space, it is also famous for its seedy, "streetwalker" element in certain areas, particularly at night, though cyclists on the main paths in daytime are unlikely to be bothered.<sup>19</sup>


### Landmark-by-Landmark Itinerary (Curated Loop)



* **Jardin d'Acclimatation:** Upon entering at Porte Maillot, the route leads to this famous Parisian amusement park and zoological garden, a family attraction since 1860.<sup>22</sup>
* **Fondation Louis Vuitton:** A stone's throw from the Jardin d'Acclimatation <sup>10</sup>, this is one of France's most important modern architectural landmarks. Designed by Frank Gehry, this "mecca for art lovers" <sup>22</sup> appears as a collection of glass sails and offers panoramic views from its terraces.
* **Parc de Bagatelle:** This 25-hectare botanical garden <sup>22</sup> is a park-within-a-park. It is famous for its small **château**, which was built in just 64 days in 1777 as the result of a bet between the Count of Artois and his sister-in-law, Marie-Antoinette.<sup>22</sup> The park is also home to a **world-famous rose garden** featuring over 1,200 varieties.<sup>22</sup>
* **Pré Catalan & Shakespeare Garden:** This large, beautiful garden <sup>19</sup> is located between the lakes and Bagatelle Park. It contains the **Shakespeare Garden**, which features plants mentioned in his plays, and an open-air theatre.<sup>22</sup>
* **Hippodrome de Longchamp:** The route continues to the legendary, historic racecourse.<sup>19</sup> Surrounding the racecourse is a continuous, flat **3.6-kilometer cycling ring**. This is a famous training venue for "keen cyclists" <sup>19</sup> in high-speed pacelines, but it is open to all and provides a safe, car-free loop.
* **The Two Lakes (Lac Inférieur & Lac Supérieur):** The heart of the park for leisurely strolls and rides. The paths follow the perimeter of the **Lower Lake (Lac Inférieur)** and the **Upper Lake (Lac Supérieur)**.<sup>19</sup> The two are connected by a small, 10-meter waterfall.<sup>22</sup> On the larger Lower Lake, rowboats are available for rent, offering a classic Parisian experience.<sup>22</sup>


## VI. Route 4: The Eastern Lung – The Lakes and Castles of Bois de Vincennes


### Route Profile



* **Name:** The Bois de Vincennes Loop
* **Approximate Distance:** ~10 km (Loop)
* **Difficulty:** Easy


### Route Description

Covering 995 hectares <sup>4</sup>, the Bois de Vincennes is Paris's *other* great "green lung," located on the eastern edge of the city. It is "perfect for cycling" <sup>4</sup> and offers a vast and perhaps more diverse set of attractions than its western counterpart. If the Bois de Boulogne represents "High Paris," the Bois de Vincennes is "Whole Paris"—a place where medieval history, major family attractions, ecological centers, and quiet nature reserves coexist.

The curated route begins at the **Porte Dorée** <sup>4</sup>, an entrance marked by the magnificent Art Deco *Palais de la Porte Dorée*, which houses the National Museum of the History of Immigration and a tropical aquarium.


### Landmark-by-Landmark Itinerary (Curated Loop)



* **Lac Daumesnil:** The route first leads to the park's most beautiful and romantic lake. It covers 12 hectares and features two distinct islands, **Île de Bercy** and **Île de Reuilly**.<sup>24</sup> The path follows the **Promenade Maurice Boitel** <sup>24</sup> around its circumference, offering views of its Second Empire charms: a suspension bridge, a grotto with an artificial waterfall, and a romantic Italian-style rotunda.<sup>24</sup>
* **Parc Zoologique de Paris (Paris Zoo):** Instantly recognizable from its 65-meter-tall "Grand Rocher" (Great Rock) <sup>24</sup>, this state-of-the-art zoo was recently renovated. It houses 2,000 animals across five "biozones" (Patagonia, Savanna-Sahel, Europe, Guiana, and Madagascar).<sup>24</sup>
* **Grande Pagode de Vincennes:** The route passes the vestiges of the 1931 Colonial Exhibition, now home to the International Buddhist Institute. The **Grande Pagode** houses the tallest golden Buddha in Europe, a 9-meter statue.<sup>24</sup>
* **Ferme de Paris (Paris City Farm):** A genuine, working, certified-organic farm within the park.<sup>24</sup> It features sheep, cows, goats, vegetable gardens, and orchards, serving as a delight for families and an educational center for urban agriculture.<sup>24</sup>
* **Parc Floral de Paris:** A 28-hectare botanical garden <sup>24</sup> designed for walking and seasonal displays. It is famous for its cherry blossoms in spring, 420 varieties of dahlias in autumn, a butterfly garden, a collection of bonsais, and family-friendly activities like mini-golf.<sup>24</sup>
* **Château de Vincennes:** The grand finale of the loop. This is France's last remaining medieval royal residence.<sup>24</sup> The route provides stunning views of its massive fortified walls and its 14th-century keep. At 52 meters, the keep is the tallest in Europe and once served as a state prison for figures like Voltaire and the Marquis de Sade.<sup>24</sup>


## VII. Route 5: The Elevated Greenway – The Coulée Verte René-Dumont


### Route Profile



* **Name:** The Coulée Verte René-Dumont (Bike-Accessible Sections)
* **Approximate Distance:** ~2.5 km (Bikeable section, one-way)
* **Difficulty:** Easy


### Route Description

This is Paris's original "Highline" <sup>25</sup>, a 4.7-km greenway built on the abandoned 19th-century Vincennes railway line.<sup>25</sup> It is a unique, "hidden" gem that offers an unusual perspective on the 12th arrondissement.

A critical expert advisory is required for this route: most tourists—and indeed, many travel guides—mistakenly assume the entire 4.7-km path is bikeable. This is incorrect. The most famous and photographed section, the elevated **Viaduct des Arts** (which runs from Bastille over artisan workshops), is **strictly pedestrian-only**.<sup>25</sup> A tourist arriving at Bastille with a bicycle will be immediately frustrated.

The *bikeable* portion of the Coulée Verte begins *after* the elevated sections, offering its own distinct charm. This route directs the cyclist to these accessible parts, which consist of tree-lined avenues, sunken pathways, and tunnels.<sup>25</sup> (Note: This route should not be confused with the "Coulée Verte du Sud Parisien," which is a completely different, longer route from Paris to Massy <sup>26</sup>).


### Landmark-by-Landmark Itinerary (The Bikeable Route)



* **Start: Jardin de Reuilly:** The bikeable route effectively begins at this large, grassy park. This is where the elevated, pedestrian-only *Viaduct des Arts* section ends, and the path descends to a wider, multi-use area.<sup>25</sup>
* **Allée Vivaldi:** This short, 0.4-km section is at street level and is shared between pedestrians and cyclists.<sup>25</sup>
* **Tunnel de Reuilly:** The path leads into a "shady" tunnel that runs for several hundred meters beneath the street <sup>25</sup>, re-creating the feeling of riding on the old train tracks.
* **La Promenade Plantée (Rue Sahel):** This is the best and longest (1.3 km) section for cycling. Here, the path runs in a "green trench" below street level, with **separate, dedicated lanes for cyclists and pedestrians**.<sup>25</sup> The lanes are separated by a green patch, making for a safe and pleasant ride.<sup>25</sup>
* **End:** The path continues towards the edge of Paris (the *périphérique*), where it can be used to connect to surface streets and continue on towards the Bois de Vincennes.<sup>25</sup>


## VIII. Expert Recommendations & Gateway to Greater France


### Practical Advisory

The routes detailed above represent the best of Paris for a visiting cyclist. To ensure a seamless experience, a final practical advisory is warranted:



* **Bike Rentals:** While Paris's public bike-share, **Vélib'**, is ubiquitous and useful for short, one-way trips <sup>8</sup>, its heavy-duty bikes are not ideal for long-distance loops. For exploring the two *Bois* (Boulogne and Vincennes), renting a lighter city bike or an e-bike from a private hire shop is recommended.<sup>4</sup>
* **Safety Recap:** The primary dangers are not cars (on these routes) but pedestrians.<sup>6</sup> Be especially cautious on the Seine banks and canal paths, where walkers, joggers, and children are abundant. Always use a bell or call out, and control your speed.


### Gateway to Greater France

A final note for the "planful connoisseur" who is inspired to go further: the central Paris routes are not dead-ends. They are, in fact, the prestigious starting points—Kilometer Zero—for France's "Grand Vélo" network of long-distance national routes.



* The **Canal de l'Ourcq** path (Route 2) connects to **La Scandibérique (EuroVelo 3)**, the "Pilgrim's Route" that runs from Norway to Spain.<sup>20</sup>
* The path from **Notre-Dame** (Route 1) is the official starting point for:
    * **La Véloscénie:** A 450-km trail to the UNESCO World Heritage site of Mont Saint-Michel.<sup>27</sup>
    * **Avenue Verte:** A 470-km route connecting Paris to London via the Dieppe ferry.<sup>27</sup>
    * **La Seine à Vélo:** The 400-km+ route that follows the river all the way to the sea at Le Havre or Deauville.<sup>11</sup>

The Parisian cycling experience, therefore, is not just a way to see the city. It is the perfect gateway to exploring the broader landscapes of France.
