# Le Vélo-Gourmand: An Expert Guide to Paris's Best Cyclist Cafés


## Paris à Vélo: The Birth of a New Terroir

In Paris, the act of riding a bicycle has profoundly evolved. It has transcended mere transportation to become the new *flânerie*—a soulful, kinetic way to experience the city's neighborhoods, secrets, and, most importantly, its flavors. This transformation did not happen by accident. It is the direct result of an ambitious and aggressive municipal strategy, the "Plan Vélo," which has woven nearly 1,000 kilometers of dedicated, protected cycle paths through the ancient city.<sup>1</sup>

The temporary "coronapistes" that emerged in 2020 have since been made permanent, forged into cycling superhighways that now define the city's major arteries.<sup>3</sup> The most dramatic example is the Rue de Rivoli, once a clogged, chaotic thoroughfare, now a 3-kilometer, car-free channel for bikes and buses, linking the Bastille to the Concorde.<sup>5</sup> This new infrastructure has fundamentally altered the relationship between the Parisian, their city, and their food. The bicycle is no longer a fringe mode of transport; it is the most privileged, efficient, and joyous way to navigate the capital.

This expanding network has, in effect, created a new kind of "terroir" for the *vélo-gourmand*: the cyclist-foodie. It is a map of taste defined by accessibility, pleasure, and newfound proximity. The cyclist can now glide from a morning *café crème* in Le Marais to a sun-drenched lunch on the banks of the Seine, all without ever competing with a car. This guide is curated for that specific, sophisticated adventurer, focusing on the two most popular cycling zones—the bohemian Canal Saint-Martin and the historic Le Marais—and the major cycling corridors they connect to.


### Defining "Bike-Friendly": The Cyclist's Criteria

To be included in this guide, an establishment must meet one of three rigorous criteria, designed for the practical needs of a discerning cyclist:



1. **The *Terrasse* View:** This is the gold standard. The café or restaurant possesses an outdoor *terrasse* (seating area) from which a rider can maintain a clear and constant line of sight to their (properly locked) bicycle. This allows for a relaxed, worry-free pause.
2. **The *Arceau* Proximity:** This is the practical standard. The establishment is located immediately adjacent to abundant, official bike parking. This primarily refers to the ubiquitous silver *arceaux* (metal hoops) installed by the city <sup>8</sup> or, in rare cases, dedicated private bike racks.<sup>10</sup> This is for stops where the *terrasse* view is impossible but security is still paramount.
3. **The On-Route Oasis:** This is the destination standard. The establishment is situated *directly* on a major, popular cycling route, such as the car-free towpaths of the canals <sup>11</sup> or the *Parc Rives de Seine*.<sup>12</sup> These are perfect, logical refueling stations that require no detour and are an integral part of the ride itself.


## The Canal Corridor (Saint-Martin & Ourcq) – The Bobo's Highway

This is arguably the most beloved leisure route for *vrai* Parisians. It’s a ride of two distinct halves, tracing the water from the bustling heart of the 10th arrondissement out into the surprisingly green, post-industrial landscapes of the 19th and beyond.


### The Route (République to Pantin)

The journey begins at the Place de la République, a major hub and the spiritual center of the city's *bobo* (bohemian-bourgeois) culture. From there, the route dives immediately onto the quays of the Canal Saint-Martin, a shaded, 19th-century waterway famed for its iron footbridges and romantic, moss-lined locks.<sup>13</sup> The route splits to follow the canal's two parallel spines: the Quai de Valmy and the Quai de Jemmapes.

It is absolutely essential for cyclists to be aware of current conditions here. The city has initiated a massive, long-term *reconfiguration de l'espace public* (reconfiguration of public space) along the Quai de Valmy, with major *travaux* (construction) planned through May 2026.<sup>15</sup> The project's goal is laudable: to widen sidewalks, plant more trees, and create new, high-quality, permanent bike paths.<sup>15</sup>

However, for the duration of this project, all bicycle traffic has been *dévié* (detoured) onto the opposite bank, the Quai de Jemmapes. To accommodate this, the Quai de Jemmapes has been temporarily converted into a *double-sens cyclable* (two-way bike lane).<sup>15</sup> This makes the Quai de Jemmapes the single, vital artery for navigating the canal for the foreseeable future.

The narrow canal eventually opens into the wide, airy Bassin de la Villette, a former industrial port turned aquatic leisure center, where Parisians gather to play *pétanque*, kayak, and drink on the waterfront *péniches* (barges).<sup>13</sup> This basin acts as a critical junction. From here, the route continues north, seamlessly transitioning onto the towpath of the Canal de l'Ourcq.<sup>18</sup> This is where the ride truly opens up. The path, a mix of smooth tarmac and packed gravel, becomes almost entirely car-free as it stretches for kilometers, past the Parc de la Villette, under the Périphérique ring road, and out toward the suburbs. This path is part of the legendary *Scandibérique* (EuroVelo 3), an international bike route connecting Norway to Spain, making this urban jaunt the first leg of a potential trans-continental adventure.<sup>20</sup>


### Curated Stops: Canal Saint-Martin (10e Arrondissement)

**1. Boulangerie: Du Pain et Des Idées**



* **Profile:** This is not merely a bakery; it is a pilgrimage. Housed in a breathtaking 19th-century *boulangerie* whose painted ceilings and beveled glass are classified as a *monument historique*, Du Pain et Des Idées is the life's work of Christophe Vasseur, a celebrated baker who left a career in fashion to pursue his craft.<sup>23</sup> The shop is an icon, pure and simple.
* **Neighborhood:** Canal Saint-Martin (10e), at 34 Rue Yves Toudic.<sup>24</sup>
* **Bike-Friendliness:** This is a cultural stop, one block from the canal.<sup>24</sup> Its bike-friendliness is rooted in its ritual. There is no large *terrasse*, but a single, large communal wooden table is set up outside the stunning blue-painted facade.<sup>25</sup> Most riders lock their bike to one of the *arceaux* on the Rue Yves Toudic <sup>29</sup> and join the (always long) queue. The *true* pro-move, embraced by all locals, is to take one's treasures *à emporter* (takeaway) and walk the 60 seconds to the canal bank, sitting on the edge of the quay to enjoy the feast.<sup>26</sup>
* **Critical Detail:** This establishment is **closed on Saturdays and Sundays**.<sup>27</sup> This is a non-negotiable, counter-intuitive fact that is essential for planning. This is a weekday-only devotion.
* **Must-Try:** Do not waste this visit on a simple croissant. The item to get is the *Escargot Pistache-Chocolat*—a dense, buttery spiral of pastry laced with vibrant pistachio paste and dark chocolate. Also, the *Pain des Amis*, a thick-crusted, nutty sourdough loaf.

**2. Café: Chez Prune**



* **Profile:** If the canal has a living room, this is it. *Chez Prune* is the quintessential *bobo* rendezvous, the "neighborhood's unofficial living room".<sup>30</sup> It's a classic corner café with vintage mosaics, a zinc bar, and a sprawling, sun-drenched *terrasse* that is packed from noon until night. It is the perfect spot for an *apéro* or a classic *croque-monsieur*.<sup>30</sup>
* **Neighborhood:** Canal Saint-Martin (10e), at 36 Rue Beaurepaire.<sup>32</sup>
* **Bike-Friendliness:** A perfect 10/10. This location scores on all criteria. It sits on a corner at the canal's edge, and its large *terrasse* offers a direct, unobstructed view of the water and the quay.<sup>32</sup> Crucially, it is one of the very few establishments in Paris with its **own dedicated bike parking rack** right at the entrance.<sup>10</sup> Public *arceaux* are also plentiful on the street.<sup>35</sup>
* **Must-Try:** A glass of chilled Sancerre and a *planche de charcuterie* (cheese and cured meat board) shared with friends around 5 PM, watching the canal locks in action.

**3. Café: La Marine**



* **Profile:** A classic, grand Parisian *brasserie* perfectly positioned on the corner of the Quai de Valmy and the Rue Dieu. If *Chez Prune* is the hip, bohemian hangout, *La Marine* is its more traditional, established counterpart, offering non-stop service from breakfast to late-night dinner in a beautiful, high-ceilinged dining room.<sup>36</sup>
* **Neighborhood:** Canal Saint-Martin (10e), at 55 bis Quai de Valmy.<sup>36</sup>
* **Bike-Friendliness:** Excellent *Terrasse* View. *La Marine* features a large, highly desirable *terrasse* that sits *directly* on the Quai de Valmy, mere feet from the bike path.<sup>37</sup> It is an ideal spot for parking a bike against the railing and enjoying a front-row seat to the canal's daily theater.
* **Actionable Detail:** As this brasserie is located on the Quai de Valmy, its *terrasse* will be directly adjacent to the neighborhood's major construction project until 2026.<sup>15</sup> This represents a trade-off: while it may introduce daytime noise, it also offers a unique, real-time view of the neighborhood's ambitious green transformation.
* **Must-Try:** A classic *steak frites* with béarnaise sauce or a simple, perfect *café crème* in the morning sun.

**4. Café: Holybelly 5**



* **Profile:** This is the undisputed mecca for Anglo-style brunch in Paris. An "Anglo-inspired" café <sup>40</sup> founded by a French couple who trained in Melbourne, *Holybelly* is famed for its specialty coffee, obsession with quality, and legendary brunch plates, especially its eggs and pancakes.<sup>41</sup>
* **Neighborhood:** Canal Saint-Martin (10e), at 5 Rue Lucien Sampaix.<sup>41</sup>
* **Bike-Friendliness:** This is a *Foodie-First* destination. Its bike-friendliness is compromised by its own wild success. It is located on a quiet side street *off* the canal.<sup>44</sup> It famously **does not take reservations** <sup>43</sup>, and the line to get in is a permanent fixture, stretching down the block.<sup>44</sup> There is no "watch-your-bike" *terrasse*. This stop is for the dedicated cyclist-foodie who is willing to securely lock their bike to *arceaux* on the street (plentiful near the Gare de l'Est and along the canal <sup>46</sup>) and wait patiently for their reward.
* **Must-Try:** The *Savoury Stack* (two pancakes, fried eggs, crispy bacon, bourbon butter, and maple syrup) and a filter coffee made with beans from their local roaster, *Belleville Brûlerie*.<sup>41</sup>

**5. Café: Ten Belles**



* **Profile:** One of the original pioneers of the Parisian third-wave coffee scene, *Ten Belles* is a "shoebox-sized" <sup>40</sup> café founded by a well-known barista champion.<sup>49</sup> It remains a standard-bearer for quality, serving "Anglo-inspired" bites like scones and sausage rolls alongside perfectly executed coffee.<sup>40</sup>
* **Neighborhood:** Canal Saint-Martin (10e), at 10 Rue de la Grange aux Belles.<sup>50</sup>
* **Bike-Friendliness:** This is a "Grab-and-Go" cultural stop. The interior is tiny, with limited seating.<sup>41</sup> Its bike-friendly status comes from the few, highly coveted wooden chairs and benches *outside* the shop's blue facade.<sup>49</sup> A cyclist can often snag one of these and keep their bike within arm's reach. Like *Du Pain et Des Idées*, the alternative pro-move is to get a coffee *to go* and walk to the canal.<sup>41</sup> Standard *arceaux* are available on nearby streets.<sup>8</sup>
* **Must-Try:** A perfect *flat white* and a homemade scone <sup>40</sup> or sausage roll.<sup>42</sup>


### Curated Stops: Bassin de la Villette & Canal de l'Ourcq (19e Arr. & Pantin)

**6. Péniche-Café: L'eau et les Rêves**



* **Profile:** This is a truly magical destination, and a perfect example of the canal's unique culture. *L'eau et les Rêves* (Water and Dreams) is a sprawling, beautifully maintained *péniche* (barge) that functions as a *librairie-botanique*—a floating bookstore and plant shop—that also contains a charming café.<sup>55</sup> It is a cultural oasis.
* **Neighborhood:** Bassin de la Villette (19e), at 9 Quai de l'Oise.<sup>55</sup>
* **Bike-Friendliness:** Perfect "On-Route Oasis." It is moored *directly* on the Quai de l'Oise, which *is* the bike path for the Canal de l'Ourcq.<sup>59</sup> You can roll your bike along the wide quay and park it mere feet from the gangplank, in full view of the barge's lovely on-deck *terrasse*.<sup>60</sup> It is a destination that feels *built* for discovery by bike.
* **Must-Try:** A *citronnade maison* (homemade lemonade) or a coffee, enjoyed on the deck while browsing a new book.

**7. Péniche-Café: Péniche Antipode**



* **Profile:** Located across the basin from *L'eau et les Rêves*, this *péniche* offers a different, more boisterous energy. The *Péniche Antipode* is a social and cultural cooperative, known for its large, friendly quay-side *terrasse*, simple, ethical food, and its role as a vibrant concert and arts venue in the evenings.<sup>61</sup>
* **Neighborhood:** Bassin de la Villette (19e), at 55 Quai de la Seine.<sup>61</sup>
* **Bike-Friendliness:** Perfect "On-Route Oasis." Like its neighbor, it is *directly* on the Bassin de la Villette's main bike path.<sup>62</sup> It boasts a large 50-square-meter *terrasse* *on the quay* <sup>65</sup>, allowing cyclists to park their bikes right at their table. It is the ideal *apéro* spot after a long ride up the canal.
* **Must-Try:** A craft beer and a shared plate of tapas as the sun sets over the wide, open water of the basin.

**8. Boulangerie: Elo - Boulangerie du Canal**



* **Profile:** This is the *true local's* refueling stop. Once a cyclist passes the Bassin de la Villette and the Parc de la Villette, they cross under the Périphérique ring road and enter the suburb of Pantin. This no-frills, high-quality *boulangerie* is the first and most essential stop on this "outer" part of the canal.
* **Neighborhood:** Pantin (93), at 44 Quai de la Marne.<sup>66</sup> (Note: Some delivery services list it in the 19e, but its physical location is in Pantin <sup>66</sup>).
* **Bike-Friendliness:** The ultimate "On-Route Oasis." It is located in Pantin, *directly* on the Canal de l'Ourcq towpath.<sup>11</sup> This is the critical stop for cyclists continuing on the EuroVelo 3 route toward the Parc Forestier de la Poudrerie <sup>19</sup> or further. It is primarily a take-away spot <sup>66</sup>, though it has a few small seats.<sup>66</sup> Parking is informal and easy on the wide, car-free quay in front.<sup>67</sup> Finding and stopping at this bakery is a badge of honor, signifying the rider has left the tourist zone and entered the domain of the dedicated cyclist.
* **Must-Try:** A *croissant* <sup>66</sup> or a *sandwich jambon-beurre* for pure, efficient, and delicious fuel.


## The Central Axes (Le Marais, Rivoli & Rives de Seine)

This is the high-energy, historic-meets-modern core of Paris. The cycling here is less about tranquil leisure and more about electric, monumental discovery. We focus on two interconnected route types: the labyrinth of Le Marais and the high-speed Rivoli-Seine axis.


### The Route (Le Marais, Rivoli, and the Seine)

1. Le Marais (3e/4e Arrondissements):

This is not a single, linear route but a "discovery ride." Le Marais is a labyrinth of narrow, medieval streets, chic boutiques, and hidden hôtels particuliers (private mansions).69 Navigating it by bike is an adventure in itself, using the network of small rues cyclables (cycling-friendly streets).71 The absolute best time to experience this area is on a Sunday. Much of the neighborhood is included in the "Paris Respire" (Paris Breathes) initiative, which closes the streets entirely to car traffic, turning the entire historic district into a cyclist's paradise.1

2. The Rivoli-Seine Axis (1e/4e/7e Arrondissements):

This is the high-speed "commuter-monumental" route. It is defined by two parallel, world-class pieces of cycling infrastructure. First, the 3-kilometer, two-way protected piste cyclable on the Rue de Rivoli, which takes riders past the Hôtel de Ville, the Louvre, and the Tuileries Garden.5 Second, and just south of it, is the Parc Rives de Seine. This 10-hectare park, built on former riverside expressways, is now a car-free oasis reserved exclusively for pedestrians and cyclists, stretching for kilometers along the Seine.1

These two zones—the Canal Corridor and the Central Axes—are perfectly linked by one of the world's most impressive bike lanes: the **Boulevard de Sébastopol**. This wide, protected, two-way path is one of the most frequented in the world, with daily passages sometimes exceeding 17,200 cyclists.<sup>74</sup> It functions as the critical North-South artery, connecting the Canal at République (Part 2) directly down to the Rue de Rivoli (Part 3), uniting the two halves of this guide.


### Curated Stops: Le Marais (3e & 4e Arr.) & Borders

**9. Vélo-Café: Le Peloton Café**



* **Profile:** This is the global home base for the visiting cyclist in Paris. As its name implies, *Le Peloton* is a café explicitly founded on the pillars of "Coffee, Community, and Cycling".<sup>76</sup> Established by the owners of the "Bike About" tour company <sup>79</sup>, it serves as a vibrant, welcoming hub for both the local and international cycling community.<sup>76</sup>
* **Neighborhood:** Le Marais (4e), at 17 Rue du Pont Louis-Philippe.<sup>79</sup>
* **Bike-Friendliness:** Perfect. This is a *vélo-café* by definition. It features a friendly *terrasse* on its quiet street.<sup>81</sup> It rents high-quality Canyon road bikes for exploration.<sup>79</sup> It sells cycling kit and, most importantly, organizes weekly group rides for all levels.<sup>82</sup> The location is ideal, just steps from the Seine bike paths and the Saint-Paul entrance to Le Marais. A Vélib' station <sup>83</sup> and public *arceaux* <sup>8</sup> are meters away.
* **Must-Try:** Their famous homemade waffles, served with specialty coffee.<sup>79</sup>

**10. Vélo-Café: Steel Coffee Shop**



* **Profile:** If *Le Peloton* is the friendly community clubhouse, *Steel* is the chic, minimalist "concept store." *Steel Cyclewear and Coffeeshop* was Paris's first bike café <sup>84</sup> and blends a high-end, curated boutique for urban and performance cycling fashion (carrying brands like Rapha and Patagonia <sup>85</sup>) with a top-tier specialty coffee bar.<sup>86</sup>
* **Neighborhood:** Oberkampf / Border of Haut-Marais (11e), at 58 Rue de la Fontaine au Roi.<sup>84</sup>
* **Bike-Friendliness:** Excellent. As it is a bike shop, cyclists and their bikes are inherently welcome. The industrial-chic space is large enough to browse with your bike in hand.<sup>84</sup> It is a *destination* for the style-conscious cyclist looking to refuel and re-equip. The surrounding streets of the 11th arrondissement are well-equipped with standard *arceaux*.<sup>8</sup>
* **Must-Try:** A perfectly pulled *espresso* <sup>90</sup> while browsing the latest high-end cycling apparel.

**11. Boulangerie: Au Petit Versailles du Marais**



* **Profile:** This is a *boulangerie* that doubles as a *monument historique*. The name is not an exaggeration. The interior is an opulent jewel box of listed, painted ceilings, intricate moldings, and chandeliers, reminiscent of the palace itself.<sup>91</sup> It is run by Christian Vabret, a *Meilleur Ouvrier de France* (MOF), a prestigious award signifying the pinnacle of French craftsmanship.<sup>91</sup>
* **Neighborhood:** Le Marais / Saint-Paul (4e), at 1 Rue Tiron.<sup>91</sup>
* **Bike-Friendliness:** Very Good. Unlike a typical takeaway bakery, this establishment is also a *salon de thé* (tea room), with a cozy, velvet-adorned seating area inside and a few small tables outside.<sup>91</sup> It is perfectly located just off the main Rue de Rivoli bike path.<sup>92</sup> For secure, long-term parking, the underground *vélostation* at the nearby Hôtel de Ville is an excellent option <sup>94</sup>, along with a local Vélib' station <sup>95</sup> and street *arceaux*.<sup>9</sup>
* **Must-Try:** This is not a place for a simple croissant. One must sit in the tea room and savor a *Tarte Tatin* or a magnificent *Paris-Brest* (a choux pastry ring with praline cream).<sup>91</sup>

**12. Café: FIKA - Institut Suédois**



* **Profile:** This is the ultimate "hidden gem" of Le Marais. *FIKA* is the charming, authentic Swedish-themed café nestled inside the *Institut Suédois* (the Swedish Institute), which is itself housed in the magnificent, 16th-century *Hôtel de Marle*.<sup>96</sup>
* **Neighborhood:** Le Marais (3e), at 11 rue Payenne <sup>99</sup> (visitor entrance is at 10 rue Elzévir).
* **Bike-Friendliness:** The most *secure* "watch-your-bike" location in this entire guide. A cyclist can ride through the grand wooden doors of the *hôtel particulier* and roll their bike directly *into* the vast, silent, cobblestone courtyard. This "oasis of calm" <sup>97</sup> is where the café's *terrasse* is located. One can park their bike against the historic stone wall, sit at a table just feet away, and enjoy a coffee in perfect, secure tranquility.
* **Must-Try:** A traditional *kanelbulle* (Swedish cinnamon bun) <sup>98</sup> and a coffee, enjoyed in the serene, sunlit courtyard.

**13. Café: Partisan Café Artisanal**



* **Profile:** A minimalist, "see-and-be-seen" specialty coffee roaster with distinct "LA vibes".<sup>100</sup> This bright, airy, and modern space is a serious hub for coffee purists and the fashion-forward crowd of the Haut-Marais.<sup>101</sup>
* **Neighborhood:** Haut-Marais / Arts et Métiers (3e), at 36 Rue de Turbigo.<sup>99</sup>
* **Bike-Friendliness:** Excellent *Terrasse* View. This café is located *directly on* a major, protected bike path <sup>99</sup> that connects the Place de la République to the main Sébastopol axis. Its defining feature is a massive, floor-to-ceiling glass facade that *entirely opens up* in good weather <sup>99</sup>, effectively turning the entire front of the café into an open-air *terrasse*.<sup>105</sup> A cyclist can lock up to the abundant *arceaux* on the sidewalk <sup>107</sup> and sit "inside" while still being only a few feet from their bike.
* **Must-Try:** A single-origin *cold brew* or an *iced latte* on a hot day—a rare and well-executed treat in Paris.<sup>101</sup>


### Curated Stops: Axe Rivoli & Rives de Seine (1e & 7e Arr.)

**14. Café: Café Marly**



* **Profile:** This is the ultimate "spectacle" stop, a "pinch-me" Parisian moment. *Café Marly* is an impossibly chic and elegant brasserie built directly into the Richelieu wing arcades of the Louvre Museum. Its world-famous *terrasse* offers a direct, breathtaking, and intimate view of I.M. Pei's iconic glass pyramid.<sup>108</sup>
* **Neighborhood:** Louvre-Rivoli (1e), at 93 Rue de Rivoli.<sup>108</sup>
* **Bike-Friendliness:** This is a "Destination" stop. One does not simply "watch" their bike here; one *arrives* in style. The café is located *directly* on the Rue de Rivoli bike "highway".<sup>6</sup> This stop is the pinnacle of the new *vélo-gourmand* lifestyle. The safe, car-free bike path now delivers a cyclist from anywhere in the city (e.g., Bastille <sup>6</sup>) directly to the palace gates. The rider can then securely lock their bike at the numerous *arceaux* in the Palais-Royal or Tuileries <sup>111</sup> and, minutes later, be seated at one of the world's most magnificent public spaces.
* **Must-Try:** The very expensive *café crème* or a coupe de champagne. One is paying for the view and the privilege <sup>110</sup>, and it is worth every centime.

**15. Péniche-Café: Rosa Bonheur sur Seine**



* **Profile:** A festive, sprawling, open-air *guinguette* (a traditional, lively dance-bar) moored on a large *péniche* (barge) at the foot of the Pont Alexandre III. It's famous for its convivial, "South of France" atmosphere, rosé on tap, wood-fired pizzas, and spectacular views of the Grand Palais.<sup>12</sup>
* **Neighborhood:** Invalides (7e), at Port des Invalides.<sup>113</sup>
* **Bike-Friendliness:** Perfect "On-Route Oasis." This is a destination *on the path*. It is located *directly on* the completely car-free *Parc Rives de Seine* bike path.<sup>1</sup> The *terrasse* *is* the quay.<sup>113</sup> Cyclists can roll their bikes right up to their table and park them on the spacious bank. It is the ideal, celebratory reward at the end of a long ride along the Seine.<sup>116</sup>
* **Actionable Detail:** This entire area (Invalides / Pont Alexandre III) was a central venue for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. As a result, massive new permanent and temporary bike parking facilities were installed, including a facility for 1,184 bikes on the nearby Quai d'Orsay <sup>118</sup>, making this one of the most bike-friendly and well-equipped zones in the entire city.
* **Must-Try:** A *pichet* (pitcher) of chilled rosé and a *pizza à la truffe* (truffle pizza) to share with friends as the sun sets behind the Eiffel Tower.


## The Cyclist's Practical Annex


### Securing Your Steed: A Guide to Parisian Bike Parking

A beautiful ride is only relaxing if the bike is secure at the destination. Paris offers several levels of parking security:



* ***Arceaux* (Hoops):** These are the most common solution—the silver metal hoops found on seemingly every street corner.<sup>8</sup> They are the standard for quick stops. A high-quality U-lock through the frame and rear wheel, supplemented by a cable for the front wheel, is essential.
* **Secure Bike Shelters:** These are the fully enclosed, grey-and-green boxes, often seen on sidewalks or in former parking spaces. They typically hold 6-10 bikes in numbered slots and require a subscription for access.<sup>8</sup>
* ***Vélostations* (Bike Stations):** This is the premium, maximum-security option. These are monitored, covered, and access-controlled parking facilities, often located in underground car parks or near major train stations.<sup>8</sup> For the stops in this guide, the most relevant *vélostations* are the massive new facilities at **Gare du Nord** and **Gare de l'Est** (for the Canal Saint-Martin) <sup>9</sup> and the large, dedicated bike park at the **Hôtel de Ville** (for Le Marais and Rue de Rivoli).<sup>94</sup>
